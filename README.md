# Deep Learning for Dropout Prediction

This project uses deep learning to investigate the factors that influence students to drop out of highschool.

### Data

This project uses data collected during the four-year study of Flint Michigan's lowest performing students, conducted from 1994-1997. The age of the data, coupled with the dramatic social changes that have occurred since, suggest that the results of this investigation may not be as applicable now as they are as an explaination of past behavior. However, this insight can still be offered for possible application, and this process can be applied to more current data as it is collected.
